## Think Like Investing Legends

Start with Buffett (value), Druckenmiller (macro trading), Lynch (growth) or Dalio (asset allocation). All 15 profiles are included in one Skill; the first four are discovery defaults, not a performance ranking. The bilingual [catalogue](catalog.json) also drives the AlphaGBM website's compact list.

Ask naturally: “Use investment-masters to examine this company through Buffett's value-investing lens. Separate supplied evidence from facts still needing verification.”

中文：像投资大师一样思考。默认展示巴菲特、德鲁肯米勒、彼得·林奇、达利欧，可展开全部15种视角。直接说：“请用 investment-masters，借鉴巴菲特的价值投资方法研究我提供的公司，区分已有证据和待核实信息。”

This is a free methodology package, not investor endorsement, a live-data service or an automated 13F monitor. Current data requires an available retrieval tool or a supported [AlphaGBM Skill](https://github.com/AlphaGBM/skills) with its own access and shared-account allowance. Never paste an API key into a conversation. Missing data stays missing.

The current catalogue has 15 profiles and four discovery defaults. The [demo files](demo/README.md) are synthetic examples of how an agent should separate a methodology lens, supplied evidence and questions still needing verification.

## What Is This?

The best "open-source code" in investing is the public record: shareholder letters, SEC filings, books, interviews, and memos. This repo distills **15 top fund managers' methodologies** into structured, actionable profiles that any AI agent or human can use.

This is not "AI roleplay as Buffett." This is **methodology extraction** -- understanding *why* they buy, *how* they manage risk, and *when* they exit.

### What Sets This Apart

| | AI Roleplay Tools | Generic Finance Bots | **Investment Masters** |
|--|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Source | LLM training data | News feeds | **Primary sources: letters, 13F, books, memos** |
| Depth | Surface-level quotes | Price alerts | **Full methodology: selection, sizing, risk, exit** |
| Evidence | "Buffett would say..." | Varies | **Profiles list sources; verify current claims against the original material** |
| Actionable | Entertainment | Information | **Maps to systematic investment rules** |
| Filing research | Varies | Varies | **Public filing links, not an automatic holdings feed** |

## Quick Start

### For Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaGBM/investment-masters.git .claude/skills/investment-masters
```

### For Cursor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaGBM/investment-masters.git .cursor/skills/investment-masters
```

Then ask your AI:

> "Distill Buffett's investment methodology"
>
> "Compare Dalio and Marks on risk management"
>
> "Read a dated Bridgewater 13F filing and list the reported holdings, filing period and source."
>
> "Write a research report on the 5 common principles"

## See a safe result shape

The [demo comparison](demo/compare-buffett-marks.md) shows the intended output: methodology first, evidence boundaries second, and no invented current holdings. The [catalogue fixture](demo/masters-preview.json) is a compact, machine-readable view of the four defaults and all 15 available profiles.

## 5 Common Principles

Despite radically different styles, all 15 converge on these:

1. **Systems Over Intuition** -- Dalio built All-weather. Simons built quant models. AQR built factor frameworks. The best investors don't rely on gut feeling.

2. **Risk Management Over Stock Picking** -- Dalio: "Diversification is the holy grail." Marks: "Risk management is not about avoiding risk, but understanding it."

3. **Clear Thesis + Willingness to Be Wrong** -- Ackman: every position has written exit criteria. Soros: exits immediately when wrong. Know why you own it.

4. **Cycle Awareness** -- Marks' pendulum. Dalio's quadrants. Tepper's panic buying. Markets swing between excess optimism and excess pessimism.

5. **Long-term > Short-term** -- Buffett: "My favorite holding period is forever." Exception: Renaissance profits from short-term statistical arbitrage.

## Read Dated 13F Filings

Public SEC EDGAR filing links are reference starting points, not a built-in data collector. Verify the reporting entity, filing period and publication date before drawing a holdings comparison:

| Master | CIK | EDGAR Link |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Bridgewater | 0001350694 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001350694&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
| Berkshire (Buffett) | 0001067983 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001067983&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
| Appaloosa (Tepper) | 0001656456 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001656456&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
| Pershing Square (Ackman) | 0001336528 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001336528&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
| Soros Fund | 0001029160 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001029160&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
| Hillhouse | 0001510057 | [13F filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001510057&type=13F&dateb=&owner=include&count=10) |
